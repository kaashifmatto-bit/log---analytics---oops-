# log-analytics-oops-
This project is a structured log analytics system built with Python that aims to illustrate clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, file handling, exception handling, environment management, and core Python concepts. Log files are read, user records are parsed, activity is analysed, reports are produced, and errors are appropriately handled by the system. The project is organised for expert repository management and is version-controlled with Git.
